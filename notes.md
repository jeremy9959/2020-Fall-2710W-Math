- 

## Other material

- proof rubric
- 


## Orientation

- syllabus
- instructor introduction
- syllabus walkthrough
- piazza 
- TeX overleaf editor (?)
- Mathematical thinking: even/odd example
- Course warnings and disclaimers, "contract"
  - read the textbook
  - use of online resources and solutions to problems
  - writing
  - relevance
  
  
- writing prompt(s): 
* introduce yourself, paragraph, complete sentences
