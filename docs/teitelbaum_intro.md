## Greetings

- Welcome to Math 2710W
- My name is Jeremy Teitelbaum
- I was born in NYC and grew up in Denver, Colorado, and have moved all around the country, living in Boston, 
Chicago, Ann Arbor, and now Coventry, CT.
- I have been at UConn since 2008
- For the first part of my career I was a pure mathematician working in number theory.  My first faculty job was at
the University of Illinois at Chicago.  About 15 years ago I became interested in administration and I eventually
moved to UConn to be dean of CLAS.  I was dean for 9 years and then spent a year as interim provost before
becoming a math professor again.  Nowadays I am interested in statistics, data science and computational mathematics.
- I am married and my wife is a middle school math teacher.  I have two grown children who live in Colorado.  We
adopted a dog right at the beginning of the pandemic, her name is Millie. 
- My hobbies include hiking, astronomy, and video games.  I also play the guitar (a little) and the banjo.
- This is my second run at teaching Math 2710 at UConn, although I taught a similar course years ago in Chicago.  This
is my first attempt at teaching a hybrid online class, and although I think it will be a challenge I am looking forward
to trying something new.
