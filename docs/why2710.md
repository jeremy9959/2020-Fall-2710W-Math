title: Why 2710?
---

## Basics of 2710

- Math 2710 is intended as preparation for the core, proof-based courses in the math major
- Aimed at students who have completed the basic calculus and linear algebra classes
- Usually students at end of second or beginning of third year of studies.

## Who *must* take 2710

- Students seeking the BA or BS degree in Mathematics
- Students seeking the BS degree in Applied Mathematics
- Students seeking the BS degree in Math-Physics with the Math Emphasis.

## Which math programs DO NOT require 2710?

- Applied Math B.A. (2710 can be used toward major, but is not required)
- Math-Physics B.S. (Physics Emphasis) (2710 can be used toward major, but is not required)
- Math-Stat B.A. (2710 can be used toward major, but is not required)
- Math-Stat B.S. (2710 can be used toward major, but is not required)
- Actuarial Science B.A.
- Actuarial Science B.S.
- Actuarial Science-Finance B.A.
- Actuarial Science-Finance B.S.

## What is 2710 about?


- The required upper division courses in the math major are **very different** than the Calculus sequence
in their approach to the subject.
- Their focus is on **theory** 
- They proceed through a sequence of **theorems** and **proofs.**
- The homework problems and test problems are primarily of the form: **Show that such and such is true** or
**Prove such and such a statement.**
- Core subjects are *Analysis*, *Algebra*, and *Topology* as well as *Number Theory* and related topics such
as *Combinatorics* and *Differential Geometry*.

### 

- Math 2710 is an introduction to this language of abstract mathematics: logic, sets, quantifiers, induction,
theorems, and proofs.  It is designed to give you the tools to pursue further study in abstract mathematics.

## Example: Analysis

Analysis is Calculus done right.  It starts with a careful definition of the real numbers and builds up
the theory of derivatives and integrals, *proving everything as you go.*

## Example: Algebra

Algebra is the study of abstract algebraic systems such as groups and rings.  Here one starts with
basic algebraic properties and uncovers deeper structure.  Linear Algebra is one part of algebra, and
the upper division linear algebra course redoes the results from Linear Algebra from an abstract point of view.

## Example: Machine Learning

The language of theorems and proofs is fundamental to advanced work in many of the more theoretical
areas of the mathematical 
sciences including computer science and statistics.  Here are some problems from a famous book on Machine Learning.

## A (very simple) proof.

**Theorem:** Prove that the sum of two even integers is even.

**Proof:**

*note:* To prove this, you need to start with a very basic question -- what is an even number?

## Success in mathematics 

There is a myth that success in mathematics is primarily driven by talent.  In fact, I have worked
with some of the greatest mathematicians in the world and what really distinguishes them is that they
have incredible stamina.  They are willing to struggle for years to understand something very complicated
and to find the right way to express it. 

This course is an introduction to this kind of mathematical work. 

## Hard-learned truths

Learning the language of theorems and proofs is very rewarding. It can open up whole worlds of new ideas
as well as help you write more clearly and discipline your thinking.  But it is *hard.*  

- Many people -- even those who think of themselves as *good at math* -- find this course *very difficult.* 
- Success in the course requires *close reading* of the text and *reflection* on the ideas in it.
- The assignments require both *problem solving* AND *writing.*
- This course is only the *first step* on a long road to learning to speak the language of mathematics. 

## Ask yourself these questions

- Are you clear in your own mind about why you are taking this course?
- Have you acknowledged that this course may be very challenging for you and you have accepted that challenge?
- Do you accept the fact that this course by itself is only a gateway to further study, and it may
require further study for you to fully appreciate what you learn in this course?
- Are you committed to working on problems that are quite abstract and often not immediately
related to applied questions?
- In addition to watching the course videos and participating in the discussions, are 
you prepared to read the textbook closely, ask questions about it, and reflect on it?
- Are you open to respectfully giving and willingly receiving 
constructive criticism from me and from your classmates?

If you do not feel that you can give a definitive yes to each of these questions, and you want to discuss
this with me further, please get in touch by email and we can talk.
