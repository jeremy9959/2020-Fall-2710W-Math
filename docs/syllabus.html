<p><span><strong>Course Description.</strong></span> This course is an introduction to mathematical proof, with examples from combinatorics, number theory, set theory, and calculus. It is a “W” course so significant time will be devoted to the proper use of mathematical notation and language.</p>
<p><span><strong>Class operation:</strong></span> I plan to teach this online course through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous methods. I will provide video discussions of key topics from the syllabus and will expect you to watch those videos and do the assigned reading outside of class. Class periods will be devoted to discussion of problems and writing samples. I expect to use a substantial portion of the class periods to meet with small groups of students from the two sections to discuss individual progress. Most of the class materials will be available through <a href="http://huskyct.uconn.edu">HuskyCT</a>. <span><em>Disclaimer:</em></span> Like all of us, I am adapting to the new world of the COVID pandemic and am learning as I go. I ask for your indulgence in advance as we feel our way forward. I promise to return that indulgence.</p>
<p><span><strong>Textbook:</strong></span> <span><em>The Book of Proof</em></span>, by Richard Hammack. This is an <span><em>open textbook</em></span> that is available for download at <a href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof">Hammack’s Website</a>. You can also purchase a paperback version of the book if you wish, but that is not required.</p>
<p><span><strong>Prerequisites.</strong></span> MATH 1132 or 1152. Cannot be taken for credit after passing MATH 2143, 3150, 3210, 3230, 3240, 3260, 3270, 3330, 3370 or 224. <span><em>Note that a grade of C or better in this course is required for the Mathematics major and is a prerequisite for many of the 3000 level courses in the department.</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Piazza.</strong></span> I will be making use of the <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kcp1cyt4u5r440">Piazza</a> web site to promote sharing of ideas and progress among the class members. Questions about the course should be directed to the piazza site. You can access piazza through the Husky CT course for the class, but you should have received an email enrolling you in the class and providing a direct link.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assessment.</strong></span> Grades in this course will be based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A take-home midterm exam, worth <span class="math inline">25%</span> of the total grade. This will be (tentatively) be distributed on October 12 with a due date of October 19.</p></li>
<li><p>A take-home final exam worth <span class="math inline">40%</span> of the final grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Homework, writing assignments, and a final writing project that will be assigned throughout the class, worth 35% of your grade in total. A major part of the assessment of this portion of the class will be based on participation. This will include in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contributing to class discussions along the parameters that I will provide as we progress;</p></li>
<li><p>Completing the writing prompts on schedule and responding to requests for revisions;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Policy Statements</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></span></p>
<p>Students are bound by the university’s policies on academic integrity.</p>
<p><span><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Students with disabilities</em></span> should contact me as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations needed during the semester due to a documented disabilities. If you have a documented disability for which you wish to request academic accommodations and have not contacted the Center for Students with Disabilities, please do so as soon as possible. The CSD is located in Wilbur Cross, Room 204 and can be reached at (860) 486-2020 or at csd@uconn.edu. Detailed information regarding the process to request accommodations is available on the CSD website at www.csd.uconn.edu.</p>
<p><span><strong>Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Inappropriate Romantic Relationships</strong></span></p>
<p>The University is committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or discriminatory harassment directed toward any person or group within its community – students, employees, or visitors. Academic and professional excellence can flourish only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. All members of the University community are responsible for the maintenance of an academic and work environment in which people are free to learn and work without fear of discrimination or discriminatory harassment. In addition, inappropriate Romantic relationships can undermine the University’s mission when those in positions of authority abuse or appear to abuse their authority. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, the University prohibits discrimination and discriminatory harassment, as well as inappropriate Romantic relationships, and such behavior will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University. More information is available at http://policy.uconn.edu/?p=2884.</p>
<p><span><strong>Sexual Assault Reporting Policy</strong></span></p>
<p>To protect the campus community, all non-confidential University employees (including faculty) are required to report assaults they witness or are told about to the Office of Diversity &amp; Equity under the Sexual Assault Response Policy. The University takes all reports with the utmost seriousness. Please be aware that while the information you provide will remain private, it will not be confidential and will be shared with University officials who can help.
