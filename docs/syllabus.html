<p><span><strong>Course Description.</strong></span> This course is an introduction to mathematical proof, with examples from combinatorics, number theory, set theory, and calculus. </p>
<p><span><strong>Textbook:</strong></span> <span><em>The Book of Proof</em></span>, by Richard Hammack. This is an <span><em>open textbook</em></span> that is available for download at <a href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof">Hammack’s Website</a>. You can also purchase a paperback version of the book if you wish, but that is not required.</p>
<p><span><strong>Prerequisites.</strong></span> MATH 1132 or 1152. Cannot be taken for credit after passing MATH 2143, 3150, 3210, 3230, 3240, 3260, 3270, 3330, 3370 or 224. <span><em>Note that a grade of C or better in this course is required for the Mathematics major and is a prerequisite for many of the 3000 level courses in the department.</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Campuswire.</strong></span> I will be making use of the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G2BCD9446/feed">Campuswire</a> web site to promote sharing of ideas and progress among the class members. Questions about the course should be directed to the campuswire site. You can access campuswire through the Husky CT course for the class, but you should have received an email enrolling you in the class and providing a direct link.</p>
<p><span><strong>Class operation:</strong></span> This is a modified "flipped" class, with the course materials online and class time devoted to discussion of homework. <span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span> We are all adapting to the new world of the COVID pandemic. I ask for your indulgence as we get all of this working correctly, and reserve the right to make changes to this as the semester progresses, depending on how it all works. If you have concerns or difficulties with the course mechanics, or the course material, PLEASE get in touch with me before things go too far!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I will provide video discussions of key topics from the syllabus and will expect you to watch those videos and do the assigned reading, and work on the assigned problems outside of class.</p></li>
<li><p>Class periods will be devoted to small group discussion of problems and writing samples. I have assigned each of you to a group of 5 or 6 people with a designated 15 minute window during each of the two class periods per week. 
The group assignments are available on <a href="http://huckyct.uconn.edu">HuskyCT</a>. During these brief conferences we will discuss homework problems. 
I will assign a selection of problems for these group discussions. <span><strong>NOTE: Participation in these discussions counts as <span class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> of your grade in the course!</strong></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Assessment.</strong></span> Grades in this course will be based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A take-home midterm exam, worth <span class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> of the total grade. This will be (tentatively) be distributed on March 5 with a due date of March 13.</p></li>
<li><p>A take-home final exam worth <span class="math inline">\(40\%\)</span> of the final grade.</p></li>
<li><p>You are required to attend and participate in the small group discussions. Your active participation in these discussions, by doing the required prep work and contributing to the discussion, is worth <span class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> of your course grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Online assessments and periodic writing assignments will contribute an additional <span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span> of your grade.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Policy Statements</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></span></p>
<p>Students are bound by the university’s policies on academic integrity.</p>

<p><span><strong>Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Inappropriate Romantic Relationships</strong></span></p>
<p>The University is committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or discriminatory harassment directed toward any person or group within its community – students, employees, or visitors. Academic and professional excellence can flourish only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. All members of the University community are responsible for the maintenance of an academic and work environment in which people are free to learn and work without fear of discrimination or discriminatory harassment. In addition, inappropriate Romantic relationships can undermine the University’s mission when those in positions of authority abuse or appear to abuse their authority. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, the University prohibits discrimination and discriminatory harassment, as well as inappropriate Romantic relationships, and such behavior will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University.

<p>To protect the campus community, all non-confidential University employees (including faculty) are required to report assaults they witness or are told about to the Office of Diversity &amp; Equity under the Sexual Assault Response Policy. The University takes all reports with the utmost seriousness.
