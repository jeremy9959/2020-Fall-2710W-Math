<h1>What is Math 2710 and should I take it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Math 2710 is intended as preparation for the core, proof-based courses in the math major</li>
<li>Aimed at students who have completed the basic calculus and linear algebra classes</li>
<li>Usually students at end of second or beginning of third year of studies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="who-must-take-it" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Who must take it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Students seeking the BA or BS degree in Mathematics</li>
<li>Students seeking the BS degree in Applied Mathematics</li>
<li>Students seeking the BS degree in Math-Physics with the Math Emphasis.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is 2710 about?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The required upper division courses in the math major are <strong>very different</strong> than the Calculus sequence in their approach to the subject.</li>
<li>Their focus is on <strong>theory</strong></li>
<li>They proceed through a sequence of <strong>theorems</strong> and <strong>proofs.</strong></li>
<li>The homework problems and test problems are primarily of the form: <strong>Show that such and such is true</strong> or <strong>Prove such and such a statement.</strong></li>
<li>Core subjects are <em>Analysis</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, and <em>Topology</em> as well as <em>Number Theory</em> and related topics such as <em>Combinatorics</em> and <em>Differential Geometry</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="analysis" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Analysis is Calculus done right. It starts with a careful definition of the real numbers and builds up the theory of derivatives and integrals, <em>proving everything as you go.</em></p>

<div id="algebra" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Algebra</h1>
<p>Algebra is the study of abstract algebraic systems such as groups and rings. Here one starts with basic algebraic properties and uncovers deeper structure. Linear Algebra is one part of algebra, and the upper division linear algebra course redoes the results from Linear Algebra from an abstract point of view.</p>

<h1>A Machine Learning Example</h1>
<p>The language of theorems and proofs is fundamental to advanced work in many of the more theoretical areas of the mathematical sciences including computer science and statistics. Here are some problems from a famous book on Machine Learning.</p>
