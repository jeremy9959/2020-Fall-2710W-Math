</div>
<div id="basics-of-2710" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Basics of 2710</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Math 2710 is intended as preparation for the core, proof-based courses in the math major</li>
<li>Aimed at students who have completed the basic calculus and linear algebra classes</li>
<li>Usually students at end of second or beginning of third year of studies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="who-must-take-2710" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Who <em>must</em> take 2710</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Students seeking the BA or BS degree in Mathematics</li>
<li>Students seeking the BS degree in Applied Mathematics</li>
<li>Students seeking the BS degree in Math-Physics with the Math Emphasis.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="which-math-programs-do-not-require-2710" class="slide section level2">

<div id="what-is-2710-about" class="slide section level2">
<h1>What is 2710 about?</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>The required upper division courses in the math major are <strong>very different</strong> than the Calculus sequence in their approach to the subject.</li>
<li>Their focus is on <strong>theory</strong></li>
<li>They proceed through a sequence of <strong>theorems</strong> and <strong>proofs.</strong></li>
<li>The homework problems and test problems are primarily of the form: <strong>Show that such and such is true</strong> or <strong>Prove such and such a statement.</strong></li>
<li>Core subjects are <em>Analysis</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, and <em>Topology</em> as well as <em>Number Theory</em> and related topics such as <em>Combinatorics</em> and <em>Differential Geometry</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Math 2710 is an introduction to this language of abstract mathematics: logic, sets, quantifiers, induction, theorems, and proofs. It is designed to give you the tools to pursue further study in abstract mathematics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="example-analysis" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Example: Analysis</h1>
<p>Analysis is Calculus done right. It starts with a careful definition of the real numbers and builds up the theory of derivatives and integrals, <em>proving everything as you go.</em></p>

</div>
<div id="example-algebra" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Example: Algebra</h1>
<p>Algebra is the study of abstract algebraic systems such as groups and rings. Here one starts with basic algebraic properties and uncovers deeper structure. Linear Algebra is one part of algebra, and the upper division linear algebra course redoes the results from Linear Algebra from an abstract point of view.</p>

</div>
<div id="example-machine-learning" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Example: Machine Learning</h1>
<p>The language of theorems and proofs is fundamental to advanced work in many of the more theoretical areas of the mathematical sciences including computer science and statistics. Here are some problems from a famous book on Machine Learning.</p>

<div id="a-very-simple-proof." class="slide section level2">
<h1>A (very simple) proof.</h1>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Prove that the sum of two even integers is even.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p><em>note:</em> To prove this, you need to start with a very basic question – what is an even number?</p>
</div>
<div id="success-in-mathematics" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Success in mathematics</h1>
<p>There is a myth that success in mathematics is primarily driven by talent. In fact, I have worked with some of the greatest mathematicians in the world and what really distinguishes them is that they have incredible stamina. They are willing to struggle for years to understand something very complicated and to find the right way to express it.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to this kind of mathematical work.</p>
</div>
<div id="hard-learned-truths" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Hard-learned truths</h1>
<p>Learning the language of theorems and proofs is very rewarding. It can open up whole worlds of new ideas as well as help you write more clearly and discipline your thinking. But it is <em>hard.</em></p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Many people – even those who think of themselves as <em>good at math</em> – find this course <em>very difficult.</em></li>
<li>Success in the course requires <em>close reading</em> of the text and <em>reflection</em> on the ideas in it.</li>
<li>The assignments require both <em>problem solving</em> AND <em>writing.</em></li>
<li>This course is only the <em>first step</em> on a long road to learning to speak the language of mathematics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ask-yourself-these-questions" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Ask yourself these questions</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Are you clear in your own mind about why you are taking this course?</li>
<li>Have you acknowledged that this course may be very challenging for you and you have accepted that challenge?</li>
<li>Do you accept the fact that this course by itself is only a gateway to further study, and it may require further study for you to fully appreciate what you learn in this course?</li>
<li>Are you committed to working on problems that are quite abstract and often not immediately related to applied questions?</li>
<li>In addition to watching the course videos and participating in the discussions, are you prepared to read the textbook closely, ask questions about it, and reflect on it?</li>
<li>Are you open to respectfully giving and willingly receiving constructive criticism from me and from your classmates?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not feel that you can give a definitive yes to each of these questions, and you want to discuss this with me further, please get in touch by email and we can talk.</p>
