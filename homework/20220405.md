# Relations

1. Let $A$ be a set and let $R=\emptyset\subset A\times A$ be the empty relation. Is $R$ symmetric?
Is $R$ transitive? Is $R$ reflexive?

2. There are $16$ relations on a two element set (why?) For each of them decide if they are reflexive,
symmetric, or transitive. 

3. Let $R$ be the relation on the integers such that $aRb$ if and only if $a|b$.  Prove that $R$ is
reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric. 

4. Give an example of a relation on the integers which is:
- not reflexive, but symmetric and transitive
- reflexive, but neither symmetric nor transitive. 
- reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive.
