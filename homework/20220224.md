### Proof by contradiction

1. Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
2. If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, then $a+b\ge 2\sqrt{ab}$.


### Other types of proofs

1. Prove that $a≡b\pmod{10}$ if and only if $a≡ b\pmod{2}$ and $a≡ b\pmod{5}$. 
2. Prove that there exists an integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $11|(2^{n}-1)$.


### Problems to try

1. Prove that the product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 120.
2. Prove that the project of any $n$ consecutive integers is divisible by $n!$.
3. Prove that, for all integers $n∈\mathbb{Z}$, the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $n+1$ is $1$.
