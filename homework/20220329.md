# Counting problems

## Some induction review

- Number of $0/1$ sequences of length $n$ with no consecutive 1's.
- Fibonacci number $F_{n}$ is even if and only if $3|n$.
- Red/blue problem

## Counting

- How many eight digit decimal numbers have a one in either their second or fourth digit?
- (Problem 10, Section 3.3) Let $X=\{P,R,O,F,S\}$. 
    - How many lists of length six can be made from elements of $X$ (allowing repetition)
    - How many lists of length six can be made that end in $S$ and contain more than one $O$?
- (10, Section 3.4) How may permutations of the digits $0$ through $9$ are there in which the digits alternate
even and odd?
- (16, Section 3.5) How many 10 digit binary strings are there that do not have exactly 4 ones?
