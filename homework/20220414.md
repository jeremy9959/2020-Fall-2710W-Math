# Functions, Injectivity, Surjectivity

## Key Definitions

1. A function $F:A\to B$ is *injective* if, whenever $a$ and $a'$ are two different elements of $A$, then $F(a)$ and $F(a')$ are two different elements of $B$.  (Sometimes called "one-to-one").
2. A function $F:A\to B$ is *surjective* if, for all $b\in B$, there exists $a\in A$ with $F(a)=b$.  Alternatively,
$F$ is surjective if its range coincides with its codomain.  (also called "onto").
3.  A function is *bijective* if it is both surjective and injective. 

## Problems

1. Let $f:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ be the function defined by $f(n,m)=3n-4m$.  If $f$ injective?
Is $f$ surjective?

2. Let $f:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ be defined by $f(m,n)=(m+n,2m+n)$.  Is $f$ injective?
Is $f$ surjective?

3. Let $X$ be a set with $m$ elements, where $m\ge 2$, and let $Y$ be a set with $2$ elements. How many surjective functions are there from $X$ to $Y$?  

4. Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and let $f:X\to Y$ be a surjective function.  Define a relation $R$ on $X$ by $xRy$ whenever
$f(x)=f(y)$.  Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation.  Describe the equivalence classes in terms of $Y$.

## Pigeonhole principle

Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets and let $f:A\to B$ be a function.   iIf $|A|>|B|$, then $f$ is not injective.
If $|A|<|B|$ then $f$ is not surjective.
