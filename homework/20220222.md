## Congruence

Congruence (or modular arithmetic) is a useful tool and is a good playground for proving things.

**Definition:** Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Then we say that $a$ is congruent to $b$
modulo $N$ (or mod $N$) if $a-b$ is divisible by $N$.  We write this
$$
a\equiv b\pmod{N}.
$$

**Examples**

- $x$ is odd if and only if $x\equiv 1\pmod{2}$.
- $37$ is congruent to $3$ mod $4$.
- Every odd number is congruent to either $1$ or $3$ mod $4$.


## Proving the contrapositive

The **contrapositive** of an implication $P\implies Q$ is $\lnot Q\implies \lnot P$.  These two statements are equivalent, so proving one is the
same as proving the other.

**WARNING:** Don't confuse the contrapositive with the *converse* $Q\implies P$.

Problems.

1.  Suppose $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers.  If $a$ does not divide $bc$, then $a$ does not divide $b$.
2.  Suppose $x\in\mathbb{R}$.  If $x^5-4x^4+3x^3-x^2+3x-4\ge 0$, then $x\ge 0$.
3.  Suppose $x$ is an integer.  If $x^3-1$ is even, then $x$ is odd.
4.  If $a\equiv b\pmod{n}$ and $c\equiv d\pmod{n}$ then $ac\equiv bd\pmod{n}$.

## Proof by contradiction

Strategy: Show $\lnot P$ implies a falsehood (like $A \land \lnot A$).  Conclude $P$ is true.

1. $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.
2. There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Strategy: To show $P\implies Q$, show that $P\land\lnot Q$ implies a falsehood.

- Show that there are no integers $a$ and $b$ such that $18a+6b=1$.
