### Comments on homework problems

1. $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational.
2. Rational points on $x^2+y^2=3$.
3.  $a^2+4a+5$ is odd if and only if $a$ is even.
4.  If $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, then $x^3+x^2y=y^2+xy$ if and only if $y=x^2$ or $y=-x$. 


### Sets
 

1. Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. Prove that $$\{ x\in\mathbb{Z} : mn|x\} \subseteq \{x\in\mathbb{Z} : m|x\} \cap \{x\in\mathbb{Z} : n|x\}. $$  When does equality hold?
2. Suppose $A, B, C$ are sets. Show $A×(B\cap C ) = (A\times B)\cap (A\times C)$.
3. Suppose $A=\emptyset$.  Prove that $A× B⊆ A× C$ if and only if $B⊆ C$.  What if $A$ is empty?

### Left over problem
