# Mathematical Induction

1. Write
$$
1\cdot 2 + 2\cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + \cdots+n(n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}
$$
in summation notation, and then prove it.  Emphasize the inductive hypothesis.

2.  Prove that $3|(n^3+5n+6)$ for every integer $n\ge 0$.

3.  Prove that
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} F_{k}^2 = F_{n}F_{n+1}
$$
where $F_{k}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fibonacci number. (Note that $F_{1}=F_{2}=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_{n}+F_{n-2}$ for integers $n\ge 3$.)

4.  Prove that the number of $n$-digit binary numbers with no consecutive $1$'s is the Fibonacci number $F_{n+2}$. So for example,
if $n=3$, there are $8$ different $3$ digit binary numbers.  Of these, $110$, $011$, and $111$ have two consecutive $1$'s, so the
remaining $5$ don't.  And, indeed, $F_{5}=5$.
