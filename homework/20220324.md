# More Mathematical Induction

**Please hand this in sheet in via HuskyCT after class.**

1.  Prove that $3|(n^3+5n+6)$ for every integer $n\ge 0$.

2.  Prove that the number of $n$-digit binary numbers with no consecutive $1$'s is the Fibonacci number $F_{n+2}$. So for example,
if $n=3$, there are $8$ different $3$ digit binary numbers.  Of these, $110$, $011$, and $111$ have two consecutive $1$'s, so the
remaining $5$ don't.  And, indeed, $F_{5}=5$.

3.  Suppose you have equal numbers $N$ of red and blue points in the plane, and no two of those points lie on a line. Then you can draw  $N$ non-intersecting line segments, each joining a red point to a blue point.

4. Let $p$ be a prime number. Then there do not exist  integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2=pb^2$.

**Proof:** Suppose there were such $a$ and $b$.  

- There is a pair $a$ and $b$ such that both are positive and $b$ is as small as possible. 

- Since $a^2$ is divisible by $p$, we know that $a$ is divisible by $p$.  
    
- Let $a=pa_1$. Then $p^2a_1^2=pb^2$ so $b^2=pa_1^2$. 
    
- Applying the same argument to $b$, we find $a_1^2=pb_1^2$.
   
- However, $b_1< b$, which contradicts $b$ being the smallest possible choice.
