# More Counting Problems

## Counting

- How many eight digit decimal numbers have a one in either their second or fourth digit?
- (Problem 10, Section 3.3) Let $X=\{P,R,O,F,S\}$. 
    - How many lists of length six can be made from elements of $X$ (allowing repetition)
    - How many lists of length six can be made that end in $S$ and contain more than one $O$?
- (10, Section 3.4) How may permutations of the digits $0$ through $9$ are there in which the digits alternate
even and odd?
- (16, Section 3.5) How many 10 digit binary strings are there that do not have exactly 4 ones?

## Pascal's Triangle/Binomial coefficients

The binomial coefficients $\binom{N}{k}$ have three defintions (at least).

1.  a recursive definition where:

- for all $N\ge 1$, $\binom{N}{0}=\binom{N}{N}=1$ 
- for all $0< k< N$, 
$$
\binom{N}{k}=\binom{N-1}{k-1}+\binom{N-1}{k}
$$

2. They also have a definition that comes from the binomial theorem; that is, you can define $\binom{N}{k}$
to be the coefficient of $x^{k}$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{N}$.

3. They also are given by a formula:
$$
\binom{N}{k}=\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}
$$

How do you show that all three definitions are the same?
