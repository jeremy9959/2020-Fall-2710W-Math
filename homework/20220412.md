# Equivalence relations (finishing up)

1. Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$. List all possible equivalence relations on $A$.

# Relations between sets/functions

## Basic definitions

- A subset $R\subset A\times B$ defines a relation between sets $A$ and $B$.
- A function $F$ is a special kind of relation between two sets $A\times B$.  When we write $F:A\to B$
we mean that 
    - $F$ is a relation on $A\times B$.
    - $F$ has the special property that, for all $a\in A$, there is a unique $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in F$.
    - The sets $A$ and $B$ are called the domain and the codomain of $F$.
    - The range of $F$ is the set $\{b\in B : \exists a\in A, (a,b)\in F\}$
Two functions are equal if they are equal as sets.

## Basic problems

1. Suppose that $F=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z} : x+3y=4\}$.  Is $F$ a function from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$?
2. Is the set $F=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R} : x+3y=4\}$ a function from $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$?
3. Is the set $F=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{R} : x+3y=4\}$ a function from $\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{R}$?
4. Is the set $F=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{Z} : x+3y=4\}$ a function from $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{Z}$?

What might a graphical depiction of the problems above look like?

## A few more

1. Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{0,1\}$.  How many relations are there on $A\times B$? How many of them are functions?

2.  More generally, let $A$ be a finite set and let $B$ be the set $\{0,1\}$.  How many functions are there from $A$ to $B$?  What is the relation between this and the power set of $A$?
