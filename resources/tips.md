COVID-19 prep for fall classes
Tips on working efficiently with Blackboard and Linux to produce online course materials

I teach math at the University of Connecticut, and like many teachers
across the country, I'm confronted with moving my courses online for
the Fall semester of 2020. At UConn, we are fortunate to have a fine
Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning that provides extensive
support and a range of tools for producing the materials we need. For
me, though, there's a catch - I'm a Linux user, and the instructions
and the tools that my university provides are almost all aimed at Mac
and Windows users. 

My goal was to produce decent quality videos
that include video of me talking and the ability to show slides on
which I could write both text and mathematics. I have on hand:

- a desktop linux machine
- a Logitech CS922 webcam
- an ipad pro
- an apple pencil. 

To get a sense of what I am able to produce, you can see a
sample here.
