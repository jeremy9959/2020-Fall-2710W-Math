Dear All,

Welcome to the Fall 2020 version of Math 2710W taught by me, Jeremy
Teitelbaum.  I hope you had a good summer, despite all of the
craziness caused by COVID-19, and are looking forward, at least a
little, to the start of the new school year.

Everything you need to know (I hope) about this course is explained in
the Course Content section called Course Introduction and Orientation
which is linked below.  So my advice is to work through that right
away. I've made the course material available as of Saturday, August
29 so you can take a look before school begins.  The rest of this email
recaps some of the high points.

I'll be teaching this course using a hybrid model.  The lectures are
available on Husky CT as video segments, and there are quick quizzes
and other assignments described there.  I've laid things out week-by-week;
hopefully, it makes sense but if not let me know.  The course calendar
in Husky CT shows the various due dates.

In addition, I've put each of you into a group with 2 or 3 other students
from your section,
and I've assigned each group a time during the period when your section
would normally have met face-to-face.  I'll meet weekly with each
group for 10-15 minutes, using blackboard ultra collaborate,
and participation in those group meetings is
required, it's part of your grade.  You should see your group
assignment on the left panel of Husky CT.  The name of the group tells
you the time. Some good news: no 8am meetings!

If for some reason you aren't in a group, or you have a problem with your group
time, get in touch by email and I'll see what I can do.

There are two things you can do right away.  First, download the textbook, which
is free.  It's called The Book of Proof and it's available here.

Second, register for piazza. This is a site we can use to ask and answer questions for the course.
You will get a separate email invitation from me -- watch for it. Just follow those instructions

My email address is jeremy.teitelbaum@uconn.edu. If you have any
difficulties, email me right away!  Also, I will hold (virtual) office
hours on Monday afternoon from 2-3:30 at my webex link.  Feel free to drop in there,
but just in case I've stepped away from my desk it's probably a good idea to email me
if you're planning to show up.

I am new to this online teaching business and I always expect technical problems.  We'll all
be patient and work things out together.

Once again, welcome aboard,

Jeremy Teitelbaum
