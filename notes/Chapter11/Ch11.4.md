# Equivalence Relations and partitions

## Partitions

**Definition:** A partition of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $A$ such that the union
of all of the subsets is $A$ and the intersection of any two of the subsets is the empty set.

Intuitively: a partition is a division of $A$ into disjoint subsets.

## Partitions (Examples)

- Integers divided into even and odd integers.

- Integers  divided into congruence classes modulo $3$.

- Books with one author divided up into classes by author.

- People grouped by their county of residence.

## Partitions and Equivalence Relations

**Theorem (11.2):**  Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $A$.  Then the equivalence classes
$\{[a]:a\in A\}$ form a partition of $A$.


## Converse to Theorem 11.2

**Proposition:** Suppose $P$ is a partition of a set $A$.  Define a relation $R$ on $A$ by setting
$aRb$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ belong to the same element of the partition.  Then $R$ is an equivalence
relation.


As a result, partitions of a set are "the same" as equivalence relations on a set.
