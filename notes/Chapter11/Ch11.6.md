# Relations between (different) sets
\renewcommand{\subset}{\subseteq}
## 

Up to now we considered a  relation $R$ on a single set $A$, viewed as a subset of the Cartesian
Product $R\subset A\times A$.

Sometimes we want to capture a relationship a different sort of relationship.  

- Consider the
a relation between the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and the set ${0,1}$ where $aR0$ if $a$ is even
and $aR1$ if $a$ is odd.  

- This can be expressed as a subset $R\subset\mathbb{Z}\times\{0,1\}$.  If we let $E$ and $O$ be the
sets of even and odd numbers respectively, then $R$ consists of 
the pairs $$(E\times\{0\})\cup (O\times\{1\}).$$

## Another example.

$S$ is the set of applicatnts for residency programs.
$R$ is the of residency programs.  

We can construct a  relation $M\subset S\times R$ where $sMr$ means that student $s$ has a applied to program
$r$

In this case the most natural picture might look like this.

## One other example

Let $S$ be a finite set and let $\mathcal{P}(S)$ be its power set.  We can define a relation $R$
between $S$ and $\mathcal{P}(S)}$ by saying that $sRx$ if $s\in X$.  What does this relation look like?
