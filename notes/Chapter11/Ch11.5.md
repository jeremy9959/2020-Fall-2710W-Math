# The integers modulo n

\newcommand{\Zn}{\mathbb{Z}_{n}}

## Formal definition of integers mod n

**Definition:** Let $n$ be a natural number greater than 1.  The set of integers modulo $n$, written $\Zn$,
is the set of equivalence classes $[a]$ for the equivalence relation defined by congruence modulo $n$.


**Remark:** The book gives a careful walkthrough of an example in the case where $n=5$.

## Properties of $\Zn$

**Proposition:** $\Zn$ has $n$ elements $\{[0],[1],\ldots, [n-1]\}$.  

## Arithmetic in $\Zn$

**Proposition:** Define $[a]+[b]=[a+b]$ and $[a][b]=[ab]$. Then these are *well-defined* operations,
meaning that if $[a]=[a']$ and $[b]=[b']$ then $[a]+[b]=[a']+[b']$, and similarly for multiplication.
