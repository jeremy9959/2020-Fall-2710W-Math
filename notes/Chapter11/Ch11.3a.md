# Selected Problems on Equivalence Relations

## 11.3.3

Let $A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$.  Suppose that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ and $R$ has three equivalence
classes. Also $aRd$ and $bRc$.  Write out $R$ as a set.

## 11.3.7

Define a relation $R$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ as $xRy$ if $3x-5y$ is even.  Prove that $R$ is an equivalence
relation and describe the equivalence classes.

## 11.3.13

Suppose that $R$ is an equivalence relation on a finite set $A$, and every equivalence
class has the same cardinality $m$.  Express $|R|$ in terms of $m$ and $|A|$.
