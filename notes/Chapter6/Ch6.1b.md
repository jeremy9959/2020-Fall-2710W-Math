## Euclid's Proof

Recall that we know that every integer can be written as a product of prime numbers. In particular,
every integer greater than $1$ has a prime divisor. 

**Proposition:** There are infinitely many primes.


## Euclid's Proof cont'd


**Proof:** Suppose that there are only finitely many prime numbers.  

- Multiply them together and let
$P$ be their product.  

- Consider the integer $P+1$.  

- This integer must have a prime divisor $p$, 
which must be greater than one, so we can write $P+1=pA$.  

- Since $P$ is the product of all the primes, we know that $p$ is a divisor of $P$, so we can write $P=pB$. 

- Therefore $1=pA-P=pA-pB=p(A-B)$.  

- This implies that $p$ is a divisor of $1$, so $p=1$. 

- We've proved that $p>1$ and $p=1$, which is a contradiction.  Thus there cannot be finitely many primes.
