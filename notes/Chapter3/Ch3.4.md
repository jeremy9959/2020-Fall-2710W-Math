## Counting Subsets

Our next problem is counting subsets of a given size chosen from a set of a given size.

**Question:** How many different $k$ element subsets does a set with $n$ elements have?

## Theorem on counting subsets

**Proposition:** The number of $k$ element subsets of a set with $n$ elements is called $\binom{n}{k}$.
This number is read "$n$ choose $k$" and it is called a "binomial coefficient".
The formula for $\binom{n}{k}$ is:
$$
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
$$

**Proof:** First we give the book's proof.

**Proof:** now we give a proof by strong induction.

## Examples

**Problem 2, page 89:** If a set has $100$ elements, how many subsets of $A$ have $5$ elements?
How many have $10$ elements?  How many have $99$ elements?
