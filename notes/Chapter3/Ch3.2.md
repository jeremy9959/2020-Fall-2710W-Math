# Addition/Subtraction Principle

## Addition Principle and Disjoint Unions

**Definition:** Two sets are said  to be  *disjoint* if $X\cap Y=\emptyset$.
Similarly, a collection $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ of sets are said to be disjoint if any pair of them is disjoint.


Note that one can have 3 sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ with $A\cap B\cap C=\emptyset$ but $A$, $B$, and $C$ are
not disjoint.


**Proposition:** Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots, X_n$ be a disjoint collection of finite sets.  Then
$$
|X_1\cup X_2\cup\cdots\cup X_n|=\sum_{i=1}^{n} |X_{i}|.
$$
\vfill

**Proposition:** Suppose that $U\subset X$.  Then $|X-U|=|X|-|U|$

## Examples

(Example 3.6) How many even 5 digit numbers are there for which:

- no digit is zero
- the digit $6$ appears exactly once.

## Problem 3

(Problem 3 from section 3.3) Five cards are dealt from a 52-card deck and lined up in a row.
How many such lineups are there in which all five cards are the same color (i.e. black or red)?

## Problem 9

(Problem 9 from Section 3.3) Consider "words" of length 6 made from the letters $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$.
How many such words are possible if each letter can occur at most one time, and the word must
contain two consecutive vowels?
