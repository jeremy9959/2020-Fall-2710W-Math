- prime factorization approach

- this method uses only division (or really, only subtraction)

- Recall Example 1.2: Describe $\{7a+3b : a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Compare with the theorem.

- Look at another examples: $a=4$ and $b=6$

- Look at the problem as: show that, among the numbers of the form $ax+by$, you can find the greatest
common divisor of $a$ and $b$.

- Key insight: experiment shows that the gcd is the smallest positive element of the set of numbers $ax+by$.
But how to prove this? 


- Let $I(a,b)=\{ax+by:x,y\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.  Notice that the sum and difference of elements of $I(a,b)$
are also in $I(a,b)$.  So if we take two (positive)
elements, we can always subtract the smaller from the larger repeatedly.
