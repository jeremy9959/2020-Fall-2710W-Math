## Disproof of existence

The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a disproof of existence; it shows that there are NO solutions
to the Fermat equation.

The disproof of a statement

"There exists $x\in S$ such that $P(x)$"

requires proving a universal statement:

"For all $x\in S$, not $P(x)$."

## Disproof of existence

**Claim:** There exists a pythagorean triple $(a,b,c)$ such that all of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are odd.

The negation of this claim is

"For all pythagorean triples $(a,b,c)$, at least one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ is even."

## Disproof of existence by contradiction

Proof by contradiction is often useful to prove "nonexistence" of something.

**Claim:** There is a real number $x$ such that $x\in(x^4, x^2)$.  (See Example 9.5).
