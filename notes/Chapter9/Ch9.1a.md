# Disproof

## The process of mathematics

Mathematics as a science advances through the formulation of conjectures and their proofs and disproof.

## A brief history of a famous problem

- Diophantus publishes *Arithmetica* in Greek Alexandria in the 3rd century CE. (10/13 chapters survive today).
- Work preserved by Arab and Persian scholars for 1000 years.

Book contains discussion of Pythagorean Triples: natural numbers $a,b,c$ such that
$$
c^2=a^2+b^2.
$$

Let $a=u^2-v^2$, $b=2uv$ and $c=u^2+v^2$ where $u$ and $v$ are natural numbers with no common factors.
For example $u=3,v=2$ so $a=5$, $b=12$, and $c=13$.  Then
$$
c^2=a^2+b^2.
$$

## More history

- 6 chapters of Diophantus work translated to Latin in the 16th century.
- Fermat, a french lawyer in Toulouse, becomes interested in mathematics. He makes many contributions.
Among them, he reads Diophantus and asks about triples $(a,b,c)$ of natural numbers that satisfy
pythagoras-like theorems with higher powers:
$$
c^3=a^3+b^3
$$
or, more generally,
$$
c^n=a^n+b^n
$$
where $n\ge 3$.
He shows that *there are no solutions in natural numbers to this equation with $n=3$ or $n=4$.

## More history

In the margin of his copy of *Arithmetica* he writes:

"There are no solutions in natural numbers to the equation $c^n=a^n+b^n$ for any $n\ge 3$. I have a wonderful
proof of this proposition but the margin of this book is too small to contain it."

This note is found by his son after his death.  

## More history

For 350 years mathematicians tried to find Fermat's proof.  This became known as Fermat's Last Theorem,
though it should have been called "Fermat's Conjecture."

In the 19th century, a number of mathematicians made progress (Kummer most notably) but the problem
remained unsolved.

There were a number of other claimed proofs that turned out to be wrong. 

## More history

In the 1970's and 1980's, several mathematicians had insight into a new possible way to prove Fermat's theorem.

In 1994, drawing on *all* of the work done before, Andrew Wiles claimed to have found a proof. But it turned
out his proof had a mistake in it, too.  However, with the help of Richard Taylor, he was able to fix the proof
and Fermat's Conjecture *finally* became a theorem after 350 years.

## Today

Mathematicians continue to work on many unsolved problems, including the Millenium problems and many,
many others.
