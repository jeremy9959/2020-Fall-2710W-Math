## Sets

- A **Set** is collection of things, called the "elements" of the set.
- Two sets are the same means they have exactly the same elements.  Knowing the elements means knowing the set.

## Describing sets by listing elements

A set can be described by listing its elements using curly braces.

$$
A = \{1,2,3\}
$$
means $A$ is the set whose elements are $1$, $2$, and $3$.  The symbols $\{$ and $\}$
are special and are used to describe sets.

**Note:** The sets $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{3,1,2\}$ are the same because they have the same elements.
So we write $A=B$.

## The $\in$ symbol

The symbol $\in$, which looks a little like a backwards $3$ and a little like a greek $\epsilon$,
means "is an element of." 

- $1\in A$ means $1$ is an element of the set $A$.  

The symbol $\not\in$ means "is not an element of."  

- $5\not\in A$ means that $5$ is not an element of $A$.

## Basic examples

- The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of counting numbers $1,2,3,\ldots$
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}
$$

- The integers are the are the positive and negative whole numbers, and zero:
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}
$$

- The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are the positive and negative fractions and zero. 

We take for granted addition, multiplication, commutative, associative, laws etc.



## Other sets

- the alphabet
- the set of words in English
- the set of people now living
- the set of chairs in my house (what's a chair....)

## The empty set

There is exactly one set which nas no elements, called the *empty set.*  
The empty set can be written $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.

## The cardinality of a set

- If $A$ is a set, we write $|A|$ for the *number of elements* in the set if that number is finite.

- If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ then $|A|=3$

- We will study cardinality in more detail at the end of the class; for now, we will take this
idea for granted.  We also take for granted that a set like $\mathbb{Z}$ has infinitely many elements.

## The real numbers

- The real numbers is the set of all numbers with possibly infinite decimal expansions (positive or negative).
A proper definition is hard to give and is usually done in analysis.  We will work with the real numbers
informally as we did in Calculus.
