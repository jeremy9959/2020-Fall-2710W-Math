# Set Proofs

## Elements of sets

Many types of theorems can be expressed as questions about the relationship between
sets.  Sometimes it's a question of membership.

**Theorem:** For any natural numbers $a$ and $b$ there exist integers $k$ and $l$ such that
$$
\gcd(a,b)=ak+bl.
$$

**Theorem:** Let $a$ and $b$ be natural numbers, and let $A=\{ax+by:x,y\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.  Then $\gcd(a,b)\in A$.

## More examples

General situation: $A=\{x\in S: P(x)\hbox{\rm\ is true}\}$.  Then 
$$
x\in A \Leftrightarrow (x\in S)\wedge P(x).
$$


- Let $A=\{3x+2: x\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.  Then $14\in A$.
\vfill
- Let $A=\{3x+2: x\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. If $x\equiv 2\pmod{3}$, then $x\in A$.

## More examples

- Let $B$ be the set of $X\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ such that, for all $x\in X$ and $y\in X$, $|x-y|<2$.


Is $\{-1,2\}\in B$?  Is $\{0,1\}$?
