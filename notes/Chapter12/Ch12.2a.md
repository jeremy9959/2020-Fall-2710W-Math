# Examples on Injective, Surjective, and Bijective functions

## Example 12.4.  

**Proposition:** The function $f:\mathbb{R}-\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by the formula $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}+1$ is injective but not surjective.

## Example 12.5.

**Proposition:** The function $f:\mathbb{R}-\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}-\{1\}$ is injective and surjective (hence bijective).

## Example 12.6

**Proposition:** The function $g:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ defined by
the formula $g(m,n) = (m+n,m+2n)$ is both injective and surjective.

## Example 12.15

Let $A=\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G\}$ and let $B=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$.  How many functions are there from $A$ to $B$?
How many of these are injective?  How many are surjective?  How many are bijective?
