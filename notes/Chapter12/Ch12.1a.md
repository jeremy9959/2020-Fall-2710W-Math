## Equality of functions

Since functions are defined to be sets, two functions are equal if they are the same set.

**Proposition:** If two functions $F$ and $G$ are equal, they have the same domain.

**Proof:** The set of $a$ such that $(a,x)\in F$ is the domain of F.  Since $F=G$, we know that
$(a,x)\in G$, so $a$ is in the domain of $G$.  This proves that the domain of F is a subset of the domain of $G$.
But the same argument shows the opposite inclusion.

**Proposition:** If two functions are equal, then $F$ and $G$ have the same range.

**Proof:** Let $x$ be in the range of $F$.  Then there exists an $a$ in the domain of F so that
$(a,x)\in F$.  Since $F=G$, we have $(a,x)\in G$, so $x$ in the range of $G$.  This proves
that the range of $F$ is contained in the range of $G$.  The opposite argument is the same.

We've proved that if $F=G$ then the domain and range of $F$ and $G$ are the same.  The converse
is false; there are lots of different functions with the same domain and range.

What is true is this:

**Proposition:** If $F$ and $G$ are functions with the same domain, then $F=G$ if and only if
$F(x)=G(x)$ for all $x$ in that domain.
