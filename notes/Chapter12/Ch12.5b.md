# Inverse functions

## Inverse functions

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let  $f\subset A\times B$ be a function ($f:A\to B$ in the alternative notation).
Since $f$ is a relation, one can consider the inverse relation $f^{-1}$.

Sometimes the inverse relation $f^{-1}$ *is* a function, and sometimes it *is not* a function.
