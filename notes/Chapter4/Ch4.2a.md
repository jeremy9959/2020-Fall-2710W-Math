## Some examples from linear algebra

**Definition:** A set $\{v_1\ldots,v_n\}$ of elements of a vector space $V$ is called *linearly independent*
if, for any set $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of scalars, if $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}v_{i}=0$ then $a_{i}=0$ for all
$i=1,\ldots, n$.  A set of elements of a vector space that is not linearly independent is called *linearly dependent.*


##

**Definition:** A set ${v_1,\ldots, v_n}$ of elements of a vector space $V$ is called a (finite) *spanning set*
if, for any $w\in V$, there exist scalars $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ so that
$$
w=\sum a_{i}v_{i}.
$$

##

**Definition:** A set ${v_1,\ldots, v_n}$ of elements of a vector space $V$ is called a (finite) *basis*
if it is both linearly independent and a spanning set.

##

**Definition:** A vector space is finite dimensional if it has a finite spanning set.
