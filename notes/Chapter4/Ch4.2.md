## Axioms

Our book does not mention axioms but it should.  Axioms are statements that are asserted to be true
for purposes of constructing a theory.  For example:

Axiom: Given a line $L$, and a point $P$ not on $L$, there is exactly one line through $P$ parallel to $L$.

Axiom: An empty set exists.

## Axioms in this course

- Existence of integers, natural numbers, rational numbers, and real numbers.  
- Properties of addition, multiplication such as commutative and associative laws, including closure.
- Properties of $>$ and $<$

## The Division Algorithm

The Division Algorithm:  Given $a,b\in\Z$ with $b>0$, there are unique integers $q$ and $r$ with $0\le r<b$
so that $a=bq+r$.

## The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Theorem: Every natural number greater than one is a product of prime numbers, and this factorization into
primes is unique up to rearranging the terms.

## Some fundamental definitions: divisibility

**Definition:** Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers.  We say that $a$ **divides** $b$, written $a|b$,
if $b=ac$ for some $c\in\Z$.  In this case we also say that $a$ is a divisor of $b$ and that $b$
is a multiple of $a$.

## GCD and LCM

**Definition:** The greatest common divisor of integers $a$ and $b$, written $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b)$,
is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.

**Definition:** The least common multiple of integers $a$ and $b$, written $\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$.
