## Basic terminology

- Definitions, Theorems, Proofs
- Axioms
- Propositions, Lemmas, Corollaries
- Conjectures

## Theorems

- Theorem.  A theorem is a mathematical statement that is proven to be true.

**Theorem:** The sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is equal to the
square of the length of the hypotenuse.

**Theorem:** The sum of two even integer is an even integer.

## Definitions

- Definition. A definition is "an exact unambiguous explanation of the meaning of a mathematical word
or phrase."

**Definition:** A "right triangle" is a triangle one of whose interior angles is a right angle.

**Definition:** A positive integer $n$  is prime if it is greater than one and its only divisors are $1$
and $n$.

**Definition:** A function $f:\R\to\R$ is continuous at $x=a$ if $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$.

- Definitions are sometimes written as "If, Then" but they are really "If and only if" statements. 

## Proofs

A proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a theorem.

A true proof of a mathematical statement is almost never given because of length.  In practice a proof
describes the key steps that are needed to construct a formal proof.  There is a social element in what
constitutes a proof which depends on the audience.

Recently some mathematicians have been advocating for computer verified proofs because mistakes
do occur in published results.

## Lemma, Proposition, Corollary

- Lemmas and Propositions are words for "less important" theorems. "Lemma" usually refers to a small theorem
that is needed to prove a bigger one.  "Proposition" is bigger then "lemma" but smaller than "Theorem."

- Corollary is a word for a theorem that is an immediate consequence of a Theorem.

Lemmas and Propositions preceed theorems; corollaries follow them.

Theorem: Any polynomial function is continuous.

Corollary: Any quadratic function is continuous.
