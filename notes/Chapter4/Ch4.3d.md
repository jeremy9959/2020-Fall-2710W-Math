## An example from linear algebra

**Definition:** A set $\{v_1\ldots,v_n\}$ of elements of a vector space $V$ is called *linearly independent*
if, for any set $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of scalars, if $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}v_{i}=0$ then $a_{i}=0$ for all
$i=1,\ldots, n$.  A set of vectors that is not linearly independent is called *linearly dependent.*

**Theorem:** The set of vectors $\{(1,3),(2,2)\}$ is linearly independent in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
