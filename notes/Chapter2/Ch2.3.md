# Conditional Statements

## If...then...
Given statements P and Q, we can form a new statement "If P, then Q".

- If (it is raining), then (it is cloudy).
- If (a number is divisible by 6), then (it is even).

These are called **conditional statements.**

Symbolically $$P\implies Q$$.

## If...then..

Truth of the first statement forces truth of the second statement.



## Alternatives

- If P, then Q
- Q if P
- Q whenever P
- Q, provided that P
- Whenever P, then also Q
- P is a sufficient condition for Q

## more alternatives


- For Q, it is sufficient that P
- Q is a necessary condition for P
- For P, it is necessary that Q
- P only if Q

##  Example

A matrix is invertible provided that its determinant is non-zero.

## Example

An integer is divisible by 8 only if it is divisible by 4.
