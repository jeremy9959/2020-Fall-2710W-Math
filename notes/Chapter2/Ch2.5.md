# Truth Tables

## Truth Tables

Compound statements can be complicated and Truth Tables let you calculate with them.


## An example

Professor says: If you  get an A on the final, 
or you get at least 90 on the homework, then you pass this course.


This statement is TRUE provided that the Professor told the truth (didn't lie) -- whether or not you get an A
in the course.

## Analysis

- You get an A in this course (P)
- You get an A on the final (Q)
- You get at least 90 on the homework (R)


The promise is:

	If (Q or R) then P.

How many possibilities?

## Truth Table

$$(Q\vee R)\implies P$$


## Another example (see the text, Ch2.5)

Let $P$ and $Q$ be any statements.  $(P\vee Q)\wedge\sim(P\wedge Q)$ reads as:

($P$ OR $Q$) and NOT ($P$ AND $Q$).


## Example

$P\iff(Q\vee R)$

- $xy=0$ if and only if $x=0$ or $y=0$.
- You will pass this course if and only if you get an $A$ on the final or at least 90 on the homework.

## Homework example

Write a truth table for $(P\wedge \sim P)\vee Q$.
