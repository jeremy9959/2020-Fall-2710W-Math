# And, Or, Not

\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}

## And, Or, and Not

Let $P$ and $Q$ be statements.

$P$ **and** $Q$ is a new statement that is True if **both** $P$ and $Q$ are True; and false otherwise.

$P$ **or** $Q$ is a new statement that is True if **either** $P$ or $Q$, or **both**, are True; and false otherwise.

**Not** $P$ is a new statement that is True if $P$ is False, and False if $P$ is $Q$.

## And

$P$ and $Q$ can be written $P\wedge Q$ (compare with set intersection).  

## OR

$P$ or $Q$ can be written $P\vee Q$ (compare with set union)

## Not

Not $P$ can be written $\sim P$, or sometimes $\neg P$.

## Examples

Write the open sentences $x\not=y$ and $y\ge x$  as  P and Q, P or Q, or not P.

## Example

Express the following in the form $P\wedge Q$, $P\vee Q$ or $\sim P$. 

$$A\in\{X\in\mathcal{P}(\N):|\overline{X}|<\infty\}$$

## Truth Tables

Truth tables are an effective way to keep track of combinations of statements.
