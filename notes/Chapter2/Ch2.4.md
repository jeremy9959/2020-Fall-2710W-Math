# Biconditionals



## The converse

Given an implication $P\implies Q$, its *converse* is the statement $Q\implies P$.

## Statement and Converse are different

If I own a BMW 335xi, then I own a car

- $P$ is "I own a BMW 335xi"
- $Q$ is "I own a car"

The converse is "If I own a car, then I own a BMW 335xi".

$P\implies Q$ is true but $Q\implies P$ is false. 

## Biconditionals or Equivalence

$P\iff Q$ means "If P, then Q" AND "If Q, then P".  It is often read "if and only if" since

- $P$ if $Q$ means $Q\implies P$
- $P$ only if $Q$ means $P\implies Q$.

It can also be read "necessary and sufficient" ($P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$).


## Truth Table for Equivalence



## Synonyms

- $P$ if and only if $Q$
- $P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$
- $P$ is equivalent to $Q$
- If $P$, then $Q$, and conversely.

## Sample problem

Put the statement "If $xy=0$ then $x=0$ or $y=0$, and conversely" in the form "P if and only if Q".
