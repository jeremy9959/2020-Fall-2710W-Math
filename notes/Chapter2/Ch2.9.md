## Example 2.8

Theorem: If $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$,
then there is a number $c\in(a,b)$ for which 
$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$


## Example 2.9

Conjecture: Every even integer greater than $2$ is the sum of two primes.



## Problem 2.3
If $x$ is prime then $\sqrt{x}$ is not rational.

Textbook answer: $P\implies \sim Q$ where $P(x)$ is "$x$ is prime" and $Q(x)$ is "$\sqrt{x}$ is a rational number."

## Problem 2.13

Everything is funny as long as it is happening to someone else. 

Textbook answer :
$$
\forall x, (\sim M(x)\wedge S(x))\implies F(x)
$$
where $M(x)$ means "$x$ is happening to me", $S(x)$ is "$x$ is happening to someone", $F(x)$ means "$x$ is funny."
