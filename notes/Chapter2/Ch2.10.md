# Negations

## Negation examples

- $x$ and $y$ are both even. ($\sim (P(x)\wedge Q(x))$)

## More examples

The square of every real number is non-negative.  ($\forall x\in\mathbb{R}, x^2\ge 0$).

There is an integer $y$ so that $y^2=20$. ($\exists y\in\mathbb{Z},y^2=20$)

## Still more

For every real number $x$ there is a real number $y$ so that $y^3=x$.  ($\forall x,\exists y, y^3=x$)


## Conditionals

- $P\implies Q$ is equivalent to $\sim P \vee Q$.  
- $\sim (P\implies Q)$ is equivalent to $P\wedge \sim Q$.

If I own a car, I am from South Dakota.

## More examples

For every positive real number $\epsilon$, there is a positive integer $M$ for which $x>M$ implies $|f(x)-b|<\epsilon$.

Note implicit "for all $x$" in the implication.

Negation:

There is a positive real number $\epsilon$ so that for all positive integers $M$ there is an $x>M$ and $|f(x)-b|\ge \epsilon$.
