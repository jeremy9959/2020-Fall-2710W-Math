# Deduction 

## Syllogism ('modus ponens')

Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are statements, that $P\implies Q$ is true, and that $P$ is true.  Then $Q$ is true.

## Indirect Proof

Suppose that $P$ and $Q$ are statements, that $P\implies Q$ is true, and that $Q$ is false. Then $P$
is false.

## Elimination

Suppose that $P\vee Q$ is true, and $P$ is false.  Then $Q$ is true.
