# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

## Euclid's Algorithm

Recall that, if $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers, there are integers $k$ and $l$ so that
$$
\gcd(a,b) = ak+bl.
$$


**Proposition:** Suppose that $n\ge 2$ and that $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ are $n$ integers.  Let $p$ be a prime
number.  If $p|(a_1\cdot a_2\cdots a_n)$ then $p$ divides at least one of the $a_i$.
