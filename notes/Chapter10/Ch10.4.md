# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

## First Step (Prop 10.1 pg 186)

Recall that, if $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers, there are integers $k$ and $l$ so that
$$
\gcd(a,b) = ak+bl.
$$


**Proposition:** Suppose that $n\ge 2$ and that $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ are $n$ integers.  Let $p$ be a prime
number.  If $p|(a_1\cdot a_2\cdots a_n)$ then $p$ divides at least one of the $a_i$.

**Proof:**

## Second Step  (Theorem 10.1, page 192)

**Proposition:** Any integer $n>1$ has a unique prime factorization, meaning it can be written as a product
of prime numbers, and any two such products differ only up to the order of the factors. 

**Step 1:** Every integer has a prime factorization (strong induction).

**Step 2:** The prime factorization is unique (minimal counterexample).
