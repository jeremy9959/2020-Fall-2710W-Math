## An example of strong induction

**Proposition:** Suppose that $n$ red dots and $n$ blue dots are arranged in the plane so that
no three dots lie on a single line.  Then you can draw $n$ line segments, each connecting one red
dot to one blue dot, in such a way that no two line segments intersect.

**Proof:** with thanks to [John Stevens](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10261/john-stevens),
and his answer to Puzzling Stack Exchange question number 16643, for the problem and the idea of the proof.
