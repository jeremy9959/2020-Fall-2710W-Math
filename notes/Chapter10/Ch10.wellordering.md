## Well ordering principle

**Proposition:** Suppose that $X$ is a non-empty set of natural numbers.  Then there exists $x\in X$ such
that, for all $y\in X$, $x\le y$.  In other words, $X$ has a minimal element.

**Proof:** We will prove that if $X$ does not have a minimal element, then it is empty,
by strong induction.

- Let $P(n)$ be the statement $n\not\in X$.
- Suppose that $X$ *does not* have a minimal element.  Then $P(1)$ is true, because if $1\in X$, then
$1$ would be a minimal element (there are no natural numbers smaller than $1$).
- Suppose that all of $P(1),P(2),\ldots, P(n)$ are all true. This means that none of $1,2,\ldots,n$ are in $X$.
But then $n+1\not\in X$, since if it were, it would be a minimal element.  Thus $P(n+1)$ is true. 
- We've proved by (strong) induction that $P(n)$ is true for all $n$.  Therefore no element of $\mathbb{N}$
belongs to $X$, so $X$ is empty.  


This proposition is called *The Well-Ordering Principle.* It is *equivalent* to the axiom of induction.
Can you prove the axiom of induction assuming the Well-ordering principle?
